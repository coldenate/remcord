RemCord - 💬 Discord RPC for RemNote 📚</h1>

<h3 align="center">A Discord RPC Connection to Remnote. Currently only works on Desktop!</h3>

<br/>

## Usage

You can use RemCord with your Desktop installation of Remnote!

 <!-- Simply open Discord and run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
As you traverse RemNote, the extension will be automatically updating your presence. -->

1. Download and run the `RemCordHelper` application from the [releases](https://github.com/coldenate/RemCordHelper/releases).
2. Open the Application and check for the `Connected to Discord` green light.
   - Sometimes, MacOS may block it. Move the app file to the Applications folder, right click on the application from Finder, hold `option` + `shift` and click open. Then click open on the new prompt.
   - When it is running, look for it in your menubar. It is a tray application. If it does not connect to Discord, click the icon, and click `Reconnect to Discord`.
3. Open RemNote and download the RemCord Plugin from the [RemNote Plugin Store](https://remnote.com/plugins/remcord).
4. If not already connected, run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
5. If the helper application is running, you should see the `Connected to RemNote` on the RemCordHelper tray app!
   - If it's not working, try editing some rems or studying your flashcard queue. Those trigger the events that talk to Discord.
6. You're all set! Start studying!!

### Troubleshooting

- Restart the RemCordHelper app **with `Discord` _and_ `RemNote` already open.**
