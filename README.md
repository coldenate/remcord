<img src=".github/assets/rn-hz-logo.svg" alt="Remnote Horiz Logo" width="500">

A Discord RPC Connection to Remnote. Currently only works on Desktop!

## Usage

You can use RemCord with your Desktop installation of Remnote!

 <!-- Simply open Discord and run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
As you traverse RemNote, the extension will be automatically updating your presence. -->

1. Download and run the `RemCordHelper` application from the [releases](https://github.com/coldenate/RemCordHelper/releases).
2. Open the Application and check for the `Connected to Discord` green light.
3. Open RemNote and download the RemCord Plugin from the [RemNote Plugin Store](https://remnote.com/plugins/remcord).
4. If not already connected, run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
5. If the helper application is running, you should see the `Connected to RemNote` green light.
6. You're all set! Start studying!!
