# Current Running 🏃 Idea

I wonder if I can make something akin to how Spotify handles Discord Activity Management. (Basically, spotify sends the information to discord which will then update the activity if you are online and have that enabled.) I wonder if I can do something similar with RemNote. I think it would be a lot easier to manage and would allow for more customization, and it could work for both desktop and web. But I don't know if it is available to the public. Because of this, I am developing the plugin to be able to modularly watch for events and respond to them with a function that can be changed. This way, if I can get the information/collaboration (because collaboration may be needed) from RemNote/Discord Docs, I can just change the function that is called when an event is triggered.

## Main Problem

I don't like how this is limited to desktop clients and people who are willing to have a whole extra program running in the background just so they can show their buds how productive they are in RemNote. 😅
